UCI Data Analytics bootcamp module 12 challenge nosql

*The 'Starter_Code' folder is where all the necessary files required for my submission are located. 

- Within this folder is a 'Resources' folder, and two jupyter notebooks; 'NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb' and 'NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb'
- 'NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb' has a markdown cell that details how to import the data from my Resources folder; open the integrated terminal from the 'Starter_Code' folder and copy/paste the code provided. The rest of the notebook is code consisting of inserting new data and updating its formatting. I additionally limited the range of outputs within this notebook for easier viewing. 
- 'NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb' is meant to be executed after the 'NOSQL_setup_starter.ipynb' notebook and performs extra analysis based on the data provided from the setup notebook and 'Resources' folder.

*** All the code provided within this repository is solely my own, originally provided by the given 'Starter_Code' file, or has been made with reference to in-class activities and/or the Xpert Learning Assistant.
